// One issue goes through plan → code → review in a pipeline, so issues don't
// wait on each other. A review that leaves blocking or should-fix findings
// starts a correction round: the coder fixes every finding in the same
// worktree, then the reviewer looks again. For findings the plan caused, the
// reviewer writes the corrected instruction itself, as a plan amendment in the
// same review. Until version 4 a separate planner agent wrote it, and that
// agent cost about as much just to start up as the whole fix step (the
// recorder's `tokens` view shows it). The review after the last correction
// round (or after a fix round that made no commit) is the last word: it grades
// the branch as it found it, then fixes what is still open itself and lists
// those ids in `self_fixed`, so every branch ends shippable and the stats show
// what the loop couldn't do. Until version 6 a separate finish agent did that
// fixing, at the price of starting one more reviewer-model agent. From
// version 8 `DEFAULT_MAX_ROUNDS` runs no correction round: the first review
// is the last, so Opus reviews once, fixes once, and the run ends. Pass
// `maxRounds` to bring the loop back.
//
// What the review was worth is measured outside this workflow:
// .claude/workflows/grade-runs.js grades every recorded run of an issue side
// by side, the review included.
//
// With `fork: true` the run compares two ways to act on the first review's
// findings, from the same findings. The first review also fixes them itself,
// on a copy of the branch in its own worktree (`<branch>-opusfix`), while the
// correction loop above carries on in the original; one more reviewer-model
// agent, `check`, then grades the copy the way a correction round's review
// would, so both arms end with a grade. The recorder splits the first
// review's tokens where it made the copy, so the copy's fixing shows as its
// own cost, the price of "the reviewer just fixes it".
//
// With `solo: true` the setup has no plan and no review: one agent
// (`models.solo`) reads the issue, implements, tests and commits it alone.
// One reviewer-model `grade` agent then grades the branch without fixing
// anything. The grade is the measurement, not part of the setup, so the
// recorder leaves its cost out of the issue's cost. This answers "would the
// strong model alone be cheaper?" on the same terms as the reviewed runs.
//
// With `base` set to a commit, the run is pinned to it. Every stage branches
// from that commit and diffs against it instead of origin/main, the planner
// skips the "already done" check, and agents read only the issue's title and
// body, since later comments may describe the fix. This keeps a benchmark
// comparable after its issues are fixed on main; /plan-code-review's `bench`
// reads the issues and the commit from tools/plan-code-review-bench.json.
// The agents still load today's CLAUDE.md, so a big change there
// shifts every setup at once: compare bench runs from about the same time.
//
// The stage models come from `args.models` and default to `DEFAULT_MODELS`.
// Different models in different runs are the experiment that
// tools/workflow-stats.mjs compares. The recorder reads `WORKFLOW_VERSION`
// from this script, so bump it when a prompt or schema changes enough to make
// old runs a different setup. Agent labels ("review #346 r2") are what the
// recorder parses, so keep their shape.
//
// Agents reach GitHub only through `gh api` (REST), never `gh issue view` or
// `gh pr list`: those use GraphQL, which cloud sessions refuse with a 403, and
// every agent would spend calls finding the REST route on its own. No
// --paginate either: it follows numeric-id links the cloud proxy refuses.
//
// Launch it from a session that is NOT inside a worktree (EnterWorktree).
// Only the code stage gets its own worktree; every later stage cds into that
// one, and an agent spawned from a worktree-isolated session inherits the
// sandbox and may not write anywhere else. The second trial run lost every
// fix round that way. A fix round that didn't move the branch now stops the
// loop and the run says so, instead of reviewing the same commit again.
//
// args: an array of issue numbers, or
//   { issues: [346, 353], tag: 'r3', maxRounds: 2, fork: true, models: { code: { model: 'sonnet', effort: 'medium' } } }
//   { issues: [346, 353, 355], base: '39cbc28b…', tag: 'b1', solo: true }
